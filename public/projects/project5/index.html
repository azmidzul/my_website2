<h3><strong>Before University</strong></h3>
<p><img src="/img/projects/image001.jpg" width="90%" /></p>
<p>I was born and raised in Singapore where I spent the first twenty years of my life. Being from Singapore, I had to undergo two years of national service, which is compulsory for all male citizens. For my national service, I was enlisted into the Singapore Police Force where I served as a front line police officer and attended to “999” emergency cases from the public. Although it was compulsory, I enjoyed my time as a policeman and was eventually promoted to a sergeant due to my exemplary work. The picture above shows the area I covered, Marina Bay, which is not only the Central Business District of Singapore but also its entertainment hub.</p>

<div id="during-university" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>During University</strong></h3>
<p>After my time as a policeman, I traveled halfway across the world to Boston, Massachusetts, USA where I attended Northeastern University. Other than having to get used to living outside of my home country for the first time in my life, I also quickly had to get adjusted to the weather in Boston. While Singapore has a tropical climate due to its location near the equator, Boston felt the full brunt of the four seasons. In fact, my first winter in Boston turned out to be the <a href="https://weather.com/news/news/new-england-boston-record-snow-tracker">snowiest winter in Boston</a> where a total of 110.6 inches of snow fell during the season. Below is a picture taken of a friend and I after one of the many snowstorms during the season.</p>
<p><img src="/img/projects/IMG_0555.JPG" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Besides getting use to the weather in Boston, I was also fortunate enough to undergo 2 seperate 7 month long internships in finance with <a href="https://www.wellington.com/en/"><em>Wellington Management</em></a>, an asset management company and also <em>Goldman Sachs</em>.</p>

<div id="after-university" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>After University</strong></h3>
<p>After university I was fortunate enough to get a job as a commodities trader with <a href="https://www.trcworld.com/"><em>TRC Corporation</em></a>, a multinational leader in agricultural commodities. This meant having to move from Boston to Kansas city. Having lived in big cities such as Boston and Singapore for my whole life, moving to Kansas was a big change as not only was I no longer surrounded by tall skyscrapers, but the pace of life was also much slower. Kansas as you would expect was surrounded mostly by farmland growing mostly soybeans and corn. After a little more than a year of living and working in Kansas, I decided that it was time for a change and I eventually moved back home to Singapore, while at the same time decided I was going to apply to do my masters in one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, London Business school. This move home turned out to be a blessing in disguise as the COVID-19 pandemic soon hit not long after I moved back. It was reassuring going through the pandemic back home with my family instead of being half way across the world in Kansas.</p>
<p>That is the quick biography of my life so far. I hope I get the opportunity to get to know your life story as well too.</p>

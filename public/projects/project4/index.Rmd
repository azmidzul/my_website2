# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). 


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()


```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.

```{r,,,fig.width=12}
# Filter and summarize count, for grouped data, with death criteria
grouped_med_death <- covid_data %>%
  filter(medcond_yn %in% c("Yes", "No"),        # Get rid of "Unknown" or "Missing" medcond_yn
         death_yn %in% c("Yes", "No"),          # Get rid of "Missing" death_yn
         death_yn != "Unknown",                 # Get rid of "Unknown" death_yn
         sex %in% c("Male", "Female"),          # Get rid of sex other than "Male" and "Female"
         age_group != "Unknown") %>%            # Get rid of age_group "Unknown"

# Filter and summarize count, for grouped data, without death criteria

Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!
